# Mixer

Demo app for cocktail mixing, showing compatible, neutral and incompatible comüponent combinations

Databases of alcoholic, non-alcoholic and non-drink components contain (in the future, in the moment only data for Vodka are available) data about mutual compatibility. 

Mix: gives the 3 available lists of cocktain components. Click on a drink, it will appear in the “Components” field (up to 8 components). Clicking the “Mix” button again will show the color-map on the lists: green – compatible with the selected drink, yellow: neutral, red: incompatible.

Update: opens the window for an update of the compatibility DBs for the selected drink.

Save/Delete: the drink combination can be saved as a private cocktail, for that one should type the name for the new cocktail in the field “Cocktails” or an existing cocktail deleted.

Load: any available private or general cocktail present in the DB can be shown in the screen, used for further analysis and mixing, and saved as a new private cocktail.

The databases should still be filled with compatibility data! Only a demo DB for Vodka is available.
